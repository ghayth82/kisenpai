# kisenpai

This library is intended to ease the process of feature engineering. Most tasks like feature extraction, selection and transformation are usually done over and over again across projects. Not only this creates duplicate code, but it is also time consuming to recopy those useful functions over and over again. With **kisenpai**, you now have a central library that handles diverse feature engineering tasks.
